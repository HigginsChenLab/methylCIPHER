\title{Download methylCIPHER Clock Data}
\usage{
download_methylCIPHER(
  clocks = c("all", "SystemsAge", "PCClocks"),
  source = c("googledrive", "zenodo"),
  path = ".",
  force = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{clocks}{A character vector specifying which clocks to download. Valid options
include `"all"`, `"SystemsAge"`, and `"PCClocks"`. The default is `"all"`, which
includes both `"SystemsAge"` and `"PCClocks"`. Multiple specific clocks can be
requested, e.g., `c("SystemsAge", "PCClocks")`.}

\item{source}{A character string specifying the download source: `"googledrive"` or
`"zenodo"`. The default is `"googledrive"`. Note that `"zenodo"` can sometimes be slow
and time out, while `"googledrive"` requires authentication via web browser.}

\item{path}{The directory path where the downloaded files will be saved.
If \code{NULL} (the default), it uses the path returned by [get_methylCIPHER_path()].}

\item{force}{A logical value indicating whether to force the download even if
the files already exist in the target directory. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to [googledrive::drive_auth()] or
[zen4R::ZenodoRecord()].}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} if downloads were attempted or if there was
  nothing to download.
}
\description{
This function downloads external data for specific methylCIPHER clocks to a specified
directory.
}
\details{
Some clocks have large data dependencies that must be downloaded before the
  clocks can be calculated. This function downloads the requested clock data to a
  specified path or the default path returned by [get_methylCIPHER_path()].
  See [get_methylCIPHER_path()] for instructions on how to set or change
  the default path.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Download all clocks to the default path
download_methylCIPHER()

# Download only "SystemsAge" to a custom path
download_methylCIPHER(clocks = "SystemsAge", path = "/path/to/directory")

# Force re-download of specified clock
download_methylCIPHER(clocks = "SystemsAge", force = TRUE)

# Download from Google Drive (may prompt for authentication)
download_methylCIPHER(source = "googledrive")
