\title{Download methylCIPHER Clock Data}
\usage{
download_methylCIPHER(
  clocks = c("all", "SystemsAge", "PCClocks", "test"),
  source = c("googledrive", "zenodo"),
  path = NULL,
  force = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{clocks}{A character vector specifying which clocks to download. Valid options
include \code{"all"}, \code{"SystemsAge"}, and \code{"PCClocks"}. The default is \code{"all"}, which
includes both \code{"SystemsAge"} and \code{"PCClocks"}. Multiple specific clocks can be
requested, e.g., \code{c("SystemsAge", "PCClocks")}.}

\item{source}{A character string specifying the download source: \code{"googledrive"} or
\code{"zenodo"}. The default is \code{"googledrive"}. Note that \code{"zenodo"} can sometimes be slow
and time out, while \code{"googledrive"} requires authentication via web browser.}

\item{path}{The directory path where the downloaded files will be saved.
If \code{NULL} (the default), it uses the path returned by \code{\link[=get_methylCIPHER_path]{get_methylCIPHER_path()}}.}

\item{force}{A logical value indicating whether to force the download even if
the files already exist in the target directory. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[googledrive:drive_auth]{googledrive::drive_auth()}} or
\code{\link[zen4R:ZenodoRecord]{zen4R::ZenodoRecord()}}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{TRUE} if downloads were attempted or if there was
nothing to download.
}
\description{
This function downloads external data for specific methylCIPHER clocks to a specified
directory.
}
\details{
Some clocks have large data dependencies that must be downloaded before the
clocks can be calculated. This function downloads the requested clock data to a
specified path or the default path returned by \code{\link[=get_methylCIPHER_path]{get_methylCIPHER_path()}}.
See \code{\link[=get_methylCIPHER_path]{get_methylCIPHER_path()}} for instructions on how to set or change
the default path.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Download all clocks to the default path
download_methylCIPHER()

# Download only "SystemsAge" to a custom path
download_methylCIPHER(clocks = "SystemsAge", path = "/path/to/directory")

# Force re-download of specified clock
download_methylCIPHER(clocks = "SystemsAge", force = TRUE)

# Download from Google Drive (may prompt for authentication)
download_methylCIPHER(source = "googledrive")
