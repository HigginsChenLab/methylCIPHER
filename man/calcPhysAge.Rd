\usage{
calcPhysAge(DNAm, pheno = NULL, ID = "Sample_ID")
}
\arguments{
\item{DNAm}{A matrix of methylation beta values with samples as rows and CpGs as columns. Must include row names (samples) and unique column names (CpGs).}

\item{pheno}{A data.frame containing sample phenotype data, with samples as rows. Must include the following columns with no missing values:
\itemize{
\item \code{Sample_ID}: Character vector of sample IDs to match with \code{DNAm}.
}}

\item{ID}{Column in \code{pheno} that indicates the ID of each sample.}
}
\value{
If you added the \code{pheno} input (preferred) the function appends a column with the clock calculation and returns the data.frame. Otherwise, it will return a data.frame of calculated clock values.
